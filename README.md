# Depot Utility

The Depot Utility is designed to automate and optimize the process of submitting dispatch requests to Dell through Dell Tech Direct. 

The Depot Utility was developed using JDK 11.0.8 and JavaFX SDK 11.0.2. 
JFoenix and CSS were used to implement the visual design of the application.
The information is stored in a local SQL Server database. 
The application communicates to the Dell Tech Direct API using SOAP/REST requests.

### Selenium: This application was converted to use api requests to improve speed and efficiency, the bulk of the previous Selenium functionality can be found here: https://github.com/GetchaPull1991/Depot-Utility/blob/493f48be34054b8de1b409f2320450143a1f2cf6/src/JosephSmith/MainUIGridPaneController.java

Features of the Warranty Utility include:
  - Allows the user to submit dispatch requests for a list of machines
  - Allows the user to remove dispatch machines from the queue
  - Allows the user to view a log containing all submitted dispatches through the application
  - Allows the user to view visual representations of dispatch requests

An update to the application to allow the creation of Technical Support requests through another Dell managed API is in progress as well as dispatch status tracking.

The look of the Depot Utility has changed slightly and the Service Now section removed to be implemented later. 
Figures and Descriptions will be updated soon.
